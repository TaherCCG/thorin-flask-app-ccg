# Thorin and Company App: My Journey

Welcome to my documentation of the Thorin and Company App Tutorial! I've just completed following a comprehensive video tutorial where I learned how to create a web application inspired by the Thorin Oakenshield and his company of dwarves from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. This tutorial was a significant milestone for me as it marked my first experience delving into web development using Python, Flask framework, Jinja2 templating engine, Bootstrap for styling, JSON for data storage, and deploying the app on Heroku. Additionally, I opted to use Gitpod instead of VS Code for my development environment.
